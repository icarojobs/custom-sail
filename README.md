# CUSTOM SAIL
This is my custom sail script used in my favorite projects.

The idea is that: install and start quickly Laravel Projects using 2 commands:

```
$ sail config
```
The *sail config* command is used to install composer dependencies rapidly.



```
$ sail init
```
The *sail init* command is used to startup all containers of docker-compose.yml

To see all possibilities, please, check the /src/sail script.

Enjoy it!
